        "Pros: Simple to implement, avoids introducing ordinal relationships.\n",
        "Cons: Can increase the dimensionality of the data significantly, especially with many categories.\n",
        "2. Label Encoding\n",
        "Concept: Assigns a unique integer to each category.\n",
        "Example: | Color | Label | |---|---| | Red | 1 | | Green | 2 | | Blue | 3 |\n",
        "Pros: Reduces dimensionality compared to one-hot encoding.\n",
        "Cons: Introduces an ordinal relationship between categories, which might not be appropriate.\n",
        "3. Ordinal Encoding\n",
        "Concept: Similar to label encoding, but used when the categories have a natural order.\n",
        "Example: | Size | Label | |---|---| | Small | 1 | | Medium | 2 | | Large | 3 |\n",
        "Pros: Preserves the ordinal relationship between categories.\n",
        "Cons: Assumes that the intervals between categories are equal, which might not always be true.\n",
        "4. Target Encoding\n",
        "Concept: Replaces each category with the mean or probability of the target variable for that category.\n",
        "Example: If the target variable is 'purchased' (binary: 0 or 1), calculate the average 'purchased' value for each color category and replace the color with that average.\n",
        "Pros: Captures information about the relationship between the categorical variable and the target variable.\n",
        "Cons: Can be prone to overfitting, especially with small datasets.\n",
        "5. Hashing Trick\n",
        "Concept: Maps each category to a unique integer using a hash function.\n",
        "Pros: Reduces dimensionality and avoids the curse of dimensionality.\n",
        "Cons: Can lead to collisions (different categories mapped to the same integer)."
